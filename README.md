# Project-2
 
Automated Data Analysis Tool

Overview

This project is an end-to-end automated data analysis pipeline that simplifies complex data preprocessing, analysis, and reporting tasks. It is designed to handle real-world datasets that often include missing values, outliers, and diverse feature types. By combining machine learning techniques, statistical analysis, and visualization tools, this script provides actionable insights efficiently.

Key Capabilities:

Data Preprocessing:

Detects and handles missing values.

Identifies and replaces outliers using statistical techniques.

Encodes categorical variables into numerical values for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Generates a correlation matrix to assess feature relationships.

Reduces data dimensions using Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

Clusters data using KMeans to identify patterns.

Visualization:

Heatmaps for missing values and correlations.

Scatter plots of PCA results.

Distribution plots for numerical columns to understand data spread.

Automated Reporting:

Generates a Markdown-based report summarizing insights, including correlation findings, PCA analysis, and clustering results.

Features and Detailed Workflow

1. Data Loading and Encoding Detection

Problem Solved: Datasets often have diverse encodings.

Solution: The script auto-detects encoding, trying UTF-8 first and falling back to ISO-8859-1 if necessary.

2. Handling Missing Values

Problem Solved: Missing values can skew analysis.

Solution:

For numeric columns: Replaces missing values with the mean.

For categorical columns: Fills missing values with the most frequent category (mode).

3. Outlier Detection

Problem Solved: Extreme values (outliers) can distort trends.

Solution:

Uses Z-scores to detect outliers.

Replaces outliers with the column’s mean.

4. Categorical Encoding

Problem Solved: Many machine learning algorithms work only with numerical data.

Solution: Converts categorical features into numeric labels using Label Encoding.

5. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Correlation Analysis:

Generates a correlation matrix to highlight relationships between features.

Helps identify multicollinearity or independent predictors.

Principal Component Analysis (PCA):

Reduces data to two components for visualization.

Preserves the maximum variance to understand key patterns.

Clustering with KMeans:

Groups similar data points into clusters to find underlying patterns.

Helps in segmenting datasets based on shared properties.

6. Visualization

The script creates the following visualizations:

Missing Values Heatmap: Highlights gaps in the dataset.

Correlation Matrix Heatmap: Shows feature relationships for better modeling.

PCA Scatter Plot: Visualizes the dataset’s structure in 2D.

Distribution Plots: Examines the spread and shape of numeric features.

7. Markdown Report Generation

Provides a concise summary of insights.

Includes the correlation matrix, PCA, and clustering results.

Automatically saves the report as README.md.
